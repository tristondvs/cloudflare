This project is for making a 'Roguelike Roulette' wheel, which will allow a user to input a list of games, create a wheel of choices, and spin the wheel to decide the next game to play. The selected game will then be removed from the list, and the remaining choices will be used.

The base of the application was assisted with the walkthrough for building a python GUI by [Taversy Media on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELkaEpN29PU)
